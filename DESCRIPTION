Description: This package replicates the famous "Monty Hall" problem - 
    originating with "Let's Make a Deal" - with various bespoke functions 
    for configuring the game's variables. It charts strategies, allows for 
    custom numbers of doors, goats, and cars, and it allows for probabilistic 
    modeling via simulations.
