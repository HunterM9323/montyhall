\title{Monty opens door(s) to reveal goats and/or cars.}
\usage{
Open_The_Floodgates(game, a.pick, Reveal_Goats = 1, Reveal_Cars = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{game}{A character vector containing "car" and "goat" values
representing the current game setup
(created by \code{Create_Monty_Hall_Game()}).}

\item{a.pick}{An integer representing the door number that the
contestant initially selected. Must be between 1 and Num_Doors.}

\item{Reveal_Goats}{This is an Integer value.
The number of goat doors Monty will open, the default is 1.
It must not exceed the number of available goat doors
(excluding the contestant's pick).}

\item{Reveal_Cars}{This is also an Integer value. The number of car doors
Monty will open, where the default is 0. It must not exceed the
number of available car doors (excluding the contestant's pick).}
}
\value{
The function returns an integer vector containing the door
number(s) that Monty opened.
The length equals Reveal_Goats + Reveal_Cars.
}
\description{
\code{Open_The_Floodgates()} determines which door(s) Monty will open
after the contestant makes their initial selection. Monty can
reveal goats and/or cars based on the game configuration, generalizing
the classic "Release_The_Goats" function from Lab 1.
}
\details{
After the contestant selects a door, Monty (who knows what's
behind each door) opens one or more of the remaining doors.
Monty will \bold{never} open the door the contestant selected.
In the classic game, Monty opens one goat door. This generalized
version allows Monty to open multiple goat doors and/or car doors,
enabling exploration of game variants such as where Monty
reveals both a goat and a car. The function handles the edge case
where sample() behaves unexpectedly with length-1 vectors
by explicitly checking candidate vector lengths before sampling.

\examples{
  # Standard game - host opens 1 goat door
  game <- Create_Monty_Hall_Game()
  pick <- Door_Select()
  Open_The_Floodgates(game, pick)

  # Generalized game - host opens 1 goat and 1 car
  game <- Create_Monty_Hall_Game(Num_Doors = 5, Num_Cars = 2)
  pick <- Door_Select(Num_Doors = 5)
  Open_The_Floodgates(game, pick, Reveal_Goats = 1, Reveal_Cars = 1)

  # Open 2 goat doors in a 10-door game
  game <- Create_Monty_Hall_Game(Num_Doors = 10, Num_Cars = 1)
  pick <- Door_Select(Num_Doors = 10)
  Open_The_Floodgates(game, pick, Reveal_Goats = 2, Reveal_Cars = 0)
