\title{Change door selection or stay.}
\usage{
change_door(stay = TRUE, opened.door, a.pick, Num_Doors = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{stay}{This is a logical value. If TRUE, the contestant stays with
their original selection. If FALSE, the contestant switches to
one of the remaining unopened doors. Default is TRUE.}

\item{opened.door}{This is an integer vector containing the door number(s)
that Monty opened.}

\item{a.pick}{This is an integer representing the door number that the
contestant originally selected.}

\item{Num_Doors}{This is an Integer. The total number of doors in the game.
Default is 3, and it \bold{must} be at least 3.}
}
\value{
The function returns an integer between 1 and Num_Doors
representing the contestant's final door selection.
}
\description{
\code{change_door()} implements the contestant's final decision to
either stay with their original door or switch to one of the
remaining unopened doors.
}
\details{
After Monty opens door(s), the contestant must decide
whether to stay with their original selection or switch to
one of the other unopened doors. If the contestant chooses to stay,
the function returns their original pick. If the contestant chooses
to switch, the function randomly selects from the remaining doors
that are neither the original pick nor any of the opened doors.
The function handles the edge case where sample() behaves
unexpectedly with length-1 vectors.
}
\examples{
  # Contestant stays with original pick
  change_door(stay = TRUE, opened.door = 2, a.pick = 1)

  # Contestant switches to remaining door
  change_door(stay = FALSE, opened.door = 2, a.pick = 1)

  # Multiple doors opened, contestant switches
  change_door(stay = FALSE, opened.door = c(2, 4), a.pick = 1, 
  Num_Doors = 5)

}
