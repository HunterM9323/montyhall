\title{Create a new \emph{Monty Hall} game.}
\usage{
create_game(Num_Doors = 3, Num_Cars = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Num_Doors}{This is an integer value. The number of doors in the game.
The default is 3, and it \bold{must} be at least 3 to ensure the game
can be played.}

\item{Num_Cars}{This is also an integer value. The number of cars
in the game. (I hope they're nice) The default is 1. It \bold{must} be
at least 1 and at most (Num_Doors - 2) to ensure
sufficient goats for Monty's reveal.}
}
\value{
The function returns a character vector of length Num_Doors
containing "car" and "goat" values indicating the positions of
goats \emph{and} cars behind each door.
}
\description{
\code{create_game()} creates a new game consisting of
a specified number of doors with cars and goats randomly
placed behind them.
}
\details{
The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
Make a Deal" where there are doors for a contestant
to choose from, some of which have cars behind them and the rest
have goats. The contestant selects a door, then Monty (Monty Hall)
opens door(s) to reveal goat(s) and/or car(s), and then the contestant
is given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
or switch to another unopened door. There was a famous
debate - largely started by Marilyn vos Savant's response in
a 1990 Parade column - about whether it was optimal to stay or switch
when given the option to switch, so this simulation was created
to test both strategies. This generalized version allows for
variable numbers of doors and cars to explore extensions of
the classic problem.

\examples{
  # Replicates the classic 3-door game with 1 car
  create_game()

  # Create a 5-door game with 2 cars
  create_game(Num_Doors = 5, Num_Cars = 2)

  # Create a 10-door game with 3 cars
  create_game(Num_Doors = 10, Num_Cars = 3)
