\title{Run a simulation of multiple Monty Hall games.}
\usage{
play_n_games(
  Num_Doors = 3,
  Num_Cars = 1,
  Reveal_Goats = 1,
  Reveal_Cars = 0,
  n = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Num_Doors}{This is an Integer value. The number of doors in each game.
The default is 3.}

\item{Num_Cars}{This is an Integer value. The number of cars in each game.
The default is 1.}

\item{Reveal_Goats}{This is an Integer value. The number of goat doors
Monty opens in each game. Its default is 1.}

\item{Reveal_Cars}{This is an Integer value. The number of car doors
Monty opens in each game. The default is 0.}

\item{n}{The most powerful letter in statistics. This is an integer
specifying the number of games to simulate. The default is 100.
Larger values converge \emph{almost surely} to the true win probabilities.}
}
\value{
The function returns a named numeric vector with two elements:
\itemize{
\item Stay: The proportion of wins when using the stay strategy
\item Switch: The proportion of wins when using the switch strategy
}
}
\description{
\code{play_n_games()} runs multiple simulations of the Monty Hall
problem and calculates the win proportions for each strategy.
}
\details{
This function runs the specified number of Monty Hall game
simulations and aggregates the results. It uses replicate() to
efficiently play N games, collects all results into a data frame,
and then calculates the proportion of wins for each strategy
(stay vs. switch). For the classic 3-door, 1-car game, the results
demonstrate that switching wins approximately 2/3 of the time while
staying wins approximately 1/3 of the time. As the number of doors, cars,
and goats is variable, statistical outcomes for a variety of
configurations can be explored.

  # Run 100 standard games (default)
  play_n_games()

  # Run 10000 games for more accurate results
  play_n_games(n = 10000)

  # Simulate Part II: 10-door, 2-car game
  play_n_games(Num_Doors = 10, Num_Cars = 2, n = 1000)

  # Simulate Part I: host reveals goat and car
  play_n_games(Num_Doors = 5, Num_Cars = 2, Reveal_Goats = 1,
  Reveal_Cars = 1, n = 1000)
